//I like to go to the gym in the morning, but I am pressed for time if I have to go to work, and depending on how much homework I have left to do.

var workDay = true; //do I have to work?
var homeWork = false; //do I have homework?


if(workDay = true){
	console.log(prompt("You have work today! Do you have homework to do?"));
}else if(homeWork = false){
	console.log("No homework? You do have time for the gym this morning!");
	//
}else{
	console.log("Sorry, no time for the gym this morning.")
}//you have work and homework, no time for gym in the morning
