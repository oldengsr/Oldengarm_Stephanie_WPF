//Stephanie Oldengarm, Sept. 18, 2013, Conditionals - Wacky

//I recently finished reading The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, and wanted to use a Victory Odds as my Wacky Conditional example.

//Prompt for District number

//Tributes with a special talent (archery, sword throwing, etc.) have a higher chance of winning tham those without.

//The Districts 1, 2, and 4 usually stand a higher chance of winning the Games, and are called Careers, because they often enjoy and train specifically to be Tributes.

//If you are from 1, 2, or 4, and possess a special talent, your odds of winning are very high.

//If you are from 1, 2 or 4, and do not possess a special talent, while it can make the Games harder, you are still in a position to win.

//District 12 is at a disadvantage to the other Districts.
